# IRIS_PROJECT

This repo is to learn how to structure ML projects. I have learned it from [Mateusz Bednarski's
Blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/structure-and-automated-workflow-for-a-machine-learning-project-2fa30d661c1e) . I am aware of mathematics of Machine Learning where I am a beginner when it comes to coding, this blog helped me putting things organized.

## Lessons

1. Object Oriented Machine Learning coding.

    > I wanted to learn it from long time, Creating model classes and all. As I am a beginner in data science career, I feel that this blog really helped me a lot in prospective of modular ML coding.

2. I learned how to handle data.
    > The collection of data is first step in ML project, and to keep them in organized is a good idea, like raw, processed, interm and external.
3. Makefile.
    > Makefile is totally new thing that I learn from this blog.
4. Testing
    > Testing is still I have to learn.
5. setup
    > packaging using setuptools

## How to use the templaate

One can simpley clone this repo to obtain the basic template for ML project of iris dataset and then he/she can edit it accordingly.
